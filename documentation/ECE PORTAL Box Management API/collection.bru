  This API implements a RESTful interface for interacting with the Portalbox System. It is consumed by our management website and the Portalboxes themselves.
  
  Users are authenticated by presenting an OAuth2 token to `api/login.php` and are issued a session cookie to authenticate subsequent requests.
